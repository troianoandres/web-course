## Comments and tips

- Use `http-server` command to start up a web server, hosted in `http://localhost:8080`, to serve your html project.
- Use the right indentation for all the files and it should be kept consistent.
- We recommend using `2` spaces as indentation for easy reading and structure.
- Try to apply all the accessibility attributes in order to provide almost full accessibility support.
- Commit in small chunks so it is easier to handle and easier to validate.
